Hi David !

this is a user profile summary using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks used).

Originally, I planned to rewrite a previous code snippet I had from another project for a weather app. However, I struggled to implement it and that is the JavaScript code that is commented out so this can be ignored.

For the final code I used a guide on youtube from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kfwbays58g and put the code in an if statement to be more defensive 

I added other things like my own styling, links and made adjustments accordingly with JS by removing or adding event listeners, making the search bar disappear (https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/html/search+field+hide+and+show+in+js) and search again button etc. Though I relied on the youtube tutorial since I struggled with my previous attempt, I do understand the whole code and concept behind

I struggled with the repos link, instead it goes to the api link haha

Thank you !
