Hi David !

this is a user profile summary using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks used).

Originally, I planned to rewrite a previous code snippet I had from another project for a weather app. However, I struggled to implement it and that is the JavaScript code that is commented out so this can be ignored.

For the final code I used a guide on youtube from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kfwbays58g and put the code in an if statement to be more defensive 

I added my own styling but relied heavily on the youtube tutorial since I struggled with my previous attempt at refactoring a code used for another project

I understand I used another programmers code in full, I still understand every element of the code and what it does
